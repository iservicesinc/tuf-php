## **T**he **U**n-opinionated **F**ramework

TUF-php is a lightweight framework for building PHP powered applications. It includes `Latte` for a templating engine, and `Phinx` for database migrations, everything else is up to you!

### ðŸš€ Quick start
1.  **Download TUF-php.**

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:iservicesinc/tuf-php.git
    cd tuf-php
    ```

1.  **Initialize the project**

    ```shell
    npm run init
    ```

1.  **Start the docker development environment.**

    ```shell
    npm run server &
    ```
    > The trailing `&` is used to start the process in the background so you can return back to the command prompt.

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!  
    Documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    ```shell
    code .
    ```
    > `code` is the command to start **VS Code** from the terminal. You should have **VS Code** already installed for this to work. Otherwise, substitute it with your preffered code editor.
    

    Have fun, and build something **TUF**!
